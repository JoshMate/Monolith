Author: Josh Mate

Version: 1.1.7

## Description
Monolith focuses on more real-world Take and Hold scenarios. You will be defending from a single main direction rather than being flanked from all directions. Some Hold Arenas are much bigger than in vanilla, and feature buildings and structures to defend from. It covers all Engagement ranges so you will test your Close, Medium, and Long Range skills! It also comes with randomly generated Supply rooms to get loot and restock between rounds just like classic.

## The Holds

1. (Long Range) Bridge. Only a single chokepoint and good for LMGs and Snipers.
2. (Long Range) Hill. Good height advantage for the player, sosigs charge uphill.
3. (Medium Range) Compound. Stealth Infiltration and good indoors CQB.
4. (Medium Range) Bunker. Only a single entrance and plenty of openings to shoot out of.
5. (Short Range) The Monolith. Small vanilla-like arena. Sosigs come from all directions.
6. (Short Range) Ventilation. Small vanilla-like arena. Sosigs come from a single direction.

## The Take and Hold Experience
Thanks to Anton's excellent code, all of the Features of T&H are reusable, so expect the full experience along with patrolling sosigs, random generation, full pre match customisation, dynamic cover, encryption nodes and more!
As the flow and difficulty of T&H was designed for the tiny vanilla arenas, you may find this map easier or harder depending on how you like to play.

## Notes
I Recommend you turn on SSAO and HDR in your in-game settings as it vastly improves visibility with this art style!

This map is still work in progress!

It is playable and fully functional

It just needs some testing and polish
