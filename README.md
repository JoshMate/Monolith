## Description
A more varied T&H experience accross 10 all new hold points featuring close, medium and long range combat.

## Intro
In the dystopian future, an evil mega-corporation named Monolith has completed its campaign to make all meat digital. Meat aisles in supermarkets are bare and BBQs just aren't the same anymore. The only way to consume delicious meat is through the pricey Monolith brand Downloadable Meat Scheme. Since Monolith controls a complete monopoly on the world’s meat supply, prices skyrocketed making even a simple sausage is now only available to the most elite in society. The Free the Meat Movement or FMM for short, is a rebel organisation who wants the world's meat supply back for all to enjoy once again. You have been selected as the FMM's finest, to infiltrate Monolith's Meat Network to obtain the precious encryption data that is essential to FMM's master plan end Monolith's reign of terror. We’re patching you into the network now, expect heavy resistance. Good luck soldier!

## The Holds

1. Bridge - long range hold featuring a long bridge to defend from 1 side.
2. Hill - long range hold featuring a good height advantage for the player.
3. Treehouse - Medium ranged verticle combat with player height advantage.
4. Bunker - Medium range hold featuring a well fortified bunker to defend.
5. Jail  - Medium range hold featuring a tall building to defend.
6. Core - Short range hold featuring lots of corners and angles.
7. Catwalk - Short range hold featuring stairs and a catwalk.
8. Monument - Short range hold featuring a large central structure.
9. Ventilation - Close range hold featuring partial cover in a tight room.
10. Storage - Close range combat with sosigs coming from 1 narrow entrance.

## The Take and Hold Experience
Thanks to Anton's excellent code, all of the Features of T&H are reusable, so expect the full experience along with patrolling sosigs, random generation, full pre match customisation, dynamic cover, encryption nodes and more!
As the flow and difficulty of T&H was designed for the tiny vanilla arenas, you may find this map easier or harder depending on how you like to play.

## FAQs

Q - **Why won't it install for me?**

A - Fully install Wurst mod and BepInEx, thats 2 dependencies! Make sure you install either x82 or x64 version of BepInEx depending on your OS, the wrong one wont work! Also make sure it is "JM_Monolith" you dropped into the "H3VR\CustomLevels\TakeAndHold" Folder, not "Monolith-master"!

Q - **Is this map still going to be worked on?**

A - Yes, all the time, all updates will be pushed to this Git repo when they are ready.

Q - **Why can't I climb the ladders / pipes / ropes?**

A - Update to the 1.3.0 or later version of Wurst Mod.

Q - **Can we have HD cool looking textures?**

A - The minimalist style runs well and fits with the lore of the map.
